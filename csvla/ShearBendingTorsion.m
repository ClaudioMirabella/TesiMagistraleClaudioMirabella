classdef ShearBendingTorsion
% SHEAR - BENDING - TORSION Class with simple functions.
%   A generic collection of useful function to evaluate Shear and
%   Bending moment distributions along the main wing span. 
%   In this class, one can find: 
%
%    1. A function to calculate a chord distribution, knowing the wing
%       surface Sw, the taper ratio lambda, the span b and a vector
%       which contains stations along the span, called y inside this
%       file.
%    2. Two functions to evaluate axial and normal forces acting on the
%       wing per unit length along the wing span. To be used the
%       function requires a knowledge of the product c(y)*Cl(y) and 
%       c(y)*Cd(y) plus the actual total angle of attack of the wing
%       with respect to the flow direction, defined as 
%       
%                  Alpha_TOT = Alpha(y) + iw(y)
%       
%       with iw the twist angle of the wing.
%    3. Two functions to evaluate shear and bending moment distribution
%       along the span of the wing. Shear force distribution is based
%       on the normal force distribution along the wing, while bending
%       moment is calculated from the shear distribution and a proper
%       arm from the wing root/aircraft longitudinal simmetry axis. 
%    4. A function that automatically plot the shear and bending moment
%       diagram along the wing span. 
%
% It is important to remember the following flight airworthiness rules:
%
% FLIGHT LOADS
%  CS - VLA 321 
%  (a) Flight load factors represent the ratio of the aerodynamic force
%      component (acting normal to the assumed longitudinal axis of the
%      aeroplane) to the weight of the aeroplane. A positive flight load
%      factor is one in which the aerodynamic force acts upward, with
%      respect to the aeroplane. 
%  (b) Compliance with the flight load requirements of this subpart must
%      shown - 
%      (1) At each critical altitude within the range in which the
%          aeroplane may be expected to operate;
%      (2) At each practicable combination of weight and disposable load
%          within the operating limitations specified in the Flight Manual.
%  
%  CS - VLA 331
%  (a) The appropriate balancing horizontal tail load must be accounted for
%      in a rational or conservative manner when determining the wing loads
%      and linear inertia loads corresponding to any of the symmetrical
%      flight conditions specified in CS - VLA 331 to 345.
%  (b) The incremental horizontal tail loads due to manoeuvring and gusts
%      must be reacted by the angular inertia of the aeroplane in a
%      rational or conservative manner.
