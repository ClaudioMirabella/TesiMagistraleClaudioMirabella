classdef aero_model
    %% aero_model - Tools for aerodynamic data interpolation 
    %   This class files are mainly devoted to define functions and methods
    %   that are able to conveniently interpolate all the aerodynamic data
    %   necessary to evluate horizontal tail balancing loads. Following
    %   airworthiness rules, it is possible to define balancing loads as
    %   follow (CS - VLA 421 Balancing loads, pag. 49/190): 
    %   
    %   (a) A horizontal tail balancing load is a load necessary to
    %       maintain equilibrium in any specified flight condition with no
    %       pitching acceleration. 
    %   (b) Horizontal tail surfaces must be designed for the balancing
    %       loads occurring at any point ON THE LIMIT MANOEUVRING ENVELOPE
    %       and IN THE FLAP CONDITIONS specified in CS - VLA 345. 
    %    
    %   This definition can be interpreted as a requirements about the
    %   structural sizing and design of the horizontal empennage in any
    %   possible flight condition that shows to be critical for structural
    %   integrity of the aircraft in static, non - accelerated flight
    %   conditions. Effects on structural sizing of accelerated flight are
    %   not taken into account in this particular case.

        function obj = CLMax(obj, a, b, c)
            % METHOD 1
            % Maximum Lift Coefficient = CLMax(a, b, c, alpha)
            %   
            %   This method is aimed to evaluate a usable maximum lift
            %   coefficient, able to take into account the fact that wings
            %   must compensate for the extra lift produced by the
            %   horizontal tail to achieve trimmed flight in any possible
            %   conditions. The function construct a second order
            %   polynomial to evaluate CLMax at high angle of attack.
            %   Applicability of this particular function is strictly
            %   limited to the case of the CS - VLA certification process
            %   for a MTOW = 100 kg drone examined as a test case.
            %   The equation used is the following:
            %   
            %   CLMax = a*(alpha)^2 + b*(alpha) + c

            %   The function can be recursively applied to store drag
